## CISP 301 - Algorithm Design and Implementation  
The first programming class I ever took.  
Contents include iterative revisions of a program lovingly known as the "payroll reporter."  

## CISP 360 - Intro to Structured Programming

## CISP 400 - Object Oriented Programming with C++
Taught by the same professor as 301, this course took an iterative approach on a dictionary application.  

## CISP 310 - Assembly Language Programming for Microcomputers  
Fairly sloppy assembly code. Very fun class, though!

	10mult - input two numbers of up to ten digits each, outputs the product

	anim - the final project was to create an animation
		   my animation features a cow grazing in a pasture.. when trouble strikes!
		   [link]

	bubsort - fills up an array with random numbers and runs a bubblesort on it

	celsius2farenheit - a simple temperature converter

	encode - 
	decode - 

	dow - enter a date & the program will tell you what day of the week it lands on, taking into account leap years.

	fibonacci - calculates the nth fibonacci number, up to 72-digit numbers. detects overflow.

	marb [marbles] - marbles experiment
		ends up generating primes

	parity

	ulam - ulam/collatz conjecture




## CISP 430 - Data Structures  
	A1:   
	A2: implementation of a sequence  
	A3: implementation of a sequence using a linked list  
	A4: implementation of a priority queue using a linked list  
	A5: a permutation-generating class which permutes a string  
	A6:   
	FINAL: code written for final exam ?, circular array  

## CISP 440 - Discrete Structures for Computer Science  
	permutations: shows all permutations or combinations of an entered number

	craps: statistical analysis of the game of craps

	3card: statistical analysis of the Three Card problem (aka the Monty Hall problem) - takes samples using various strategies and reports the win rate

	graph: checks if two graphs are isomorphic - if so, display the bijection
