(Program Design --> Data Design + Algorithms Design)

Data Design
	Declare TAXRATE as constant float = 15%
	Declare lastName, firstName, fullName as string
	Declare payrate,hours,gross as float
	Declare tax, netpay as float
	Declare answer as character
	Declare reportFile as file

Algorithms Design

	Open report file for write access
	print report headings to file

	DO WHILE (answer == Y | answer == y)
		input lastName, firstName
		input hours and payrate

			IF (hours <= 40)
				calculate gross without overtime pay
			ELSE
				calculate gross with overtime pay
			ENDIF

		calculate tax as 15% of gross
		calculate netpay as gross – tax
		calculate lastName and firstName with comma-space

		print payroll report to screen and file

	prompt for another employee
	input answer (y/n)

	close report file
	print report success
END
